## webRTCCopy

https://www.rtccopy.com

Using the library https://raw.github.com/erbbysam/webRTC-data.io to create a IM/filesharing website.
Tested & working in Chrome, Firefox & Opera.

### WebRTC Connection Note
This website does require a reliable WebRTC connection, which is only supported in Chrome, Firefox & Opera.

Communication between Chrome & Opera is working.

Communication between Firefox and Chrome/Opera is working.

### File IO note
At no point is data stored in the browsers memory. This code will write and read directly from disk, except Firefox which cannot write directly to disk.
This is because we must use [idb.filesystem.js] (https://github.com/ebidel/idb.filesystem.js) to mimic the HTML5 FileSystem API for Firefox. It's one limitation is that we cannot provide the user with a file link directly from this (like we can with Chrome). So we must instead write to it, then grab the file as a blob and place it into JS memory so the user can then download it to their local file system.

### WebRTC datachannel note
Each chunk of a file is requested by the receiving end (a file is divided into many 256k chunks), only after the previous chunk has been received (each chunk is sent over in smaller 16k pieces). This is done this way because, there is no way easily send large amounts of data without first dividing it up further, see:

### Additional crypto/OTR information
OTR has been disabled on rtccopy.com. It is not safe to trust a 3rd party server to deliver cryptographic code. In order to use this feature, please host at least the client portion of the site yourself. Also, OTR is likely no longer needed to add authentication. This is because, during the initial SDP negotiation, a fingerprint of each peer's key is communicated. As long as the connection to the signaling server is secure & the signaling server is trustworthy, authentication can be guaranteed.

For details on the OTR implementation see:

https://rtccopy.com/white_paper.html (notes on insecurity of WebRTC on this page might be incorrect)

### Install
(currently hosted on Ubuntu, but any linux server will likely work)

Copy client directory to web server public directory (ie. /var/www/)

Copy the server directory to a non-public folder (ie. your user folder ~/)

To start the server:
```
npm install ws express
node ~/server/site/server.js (or use the forever node.js module to keep it running)
or for secure/wss: 
node ~/server/site/server-secure.js (or use the forever node.js module to keep it running)
```

That's it!
